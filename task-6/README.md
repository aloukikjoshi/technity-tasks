# 🎬 MovieMavenBot - Your Movie Information Bot

MovieMavenBot is ones' go-to Telegram Bot for fetching movie information instantly! Just type "/movie {movie name}" in your chat, and let the magic happen. 🪄 Developed in just 5 days with a little help from my friend [Nihal Pandey](https://github.com/neurotoxin5060/), MovieMavenBot uses the power of the [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/).

## 🚀 Resources Utilized

I embarked on this exciting journey with a handful of resources:

- [🤖 Bot Father](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather): The creator of MovieMavenBot! Bot Father helped me create my very own Telegram Bot and obtain the essential Bot Token.

- [📽️ OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/): The heart of MovieMavenBot, providing movie details at my fingertips.

- [📚 Oracle® Load Testing Load Testing User's Guide Version 9.20](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E25294_01/doc.920/e15484/oltappxa.htm): A valuable resource that guided me through understanding error codes and success codes.

- [🐍 Automate the Boring Stuff with Python - Chapter 16](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter16/): This resource proved handy in mastering the art of dumping data into a CSV file.

- [🌐 w3schools - Python Request Modules](https://www.w3schools.com/python/module_requests.asp): My go-to reference for learning about Request Modules in Python.

## 🔒 Privacy and Security

To ensure the security of MovieMavenBot, I've taken measures to protect sensitive information. The use of a `.gitignore` file keeps the Telegram Token and OMDB API details hidden.

## 📂 File Storage

For your convenience, GIFs and screenshots related to the project are stored right here in this folder. The CSV file containing precious movie information is securely kept in the main branch folder (outside the task-6 folder).
