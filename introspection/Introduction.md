# Introduction

## HelloðŸ‘‹
I am Aloukik Joshi, currently enrolled in the B.Tech program for Computer Science and Engineering at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amaravati. My primary areas of expertise within the realm of computing are SQL and Web Development. I have a strong affinity for working on web projects, where I can leverage my skills effectively. Notably, I have garnered positive feedback for my interpersonal skills, and my friendly demeanor is well-received by others. Alongside my technical capabilities, I excel in communication and exhibit adept leadership qualities.
