# Introduction

## Helloüëã
I am Aloukik Joshi, currently enrolled in the B.Tech program for Computer Science and Engineering at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amaravati. My primary areas of expertise within the realm of computing are SQL and Web Development. I have a strong affinity for working on web projects, where I can leverage my skills effectively. Notably, I have garnered positive feedback for my interpersonal skills, and my friendly demeanor is well-received by others. Alongside my technical capabilities, I excel in communication and exhibit adept leadership qualities.

## Fusion of Design and Code üé®üíª
My journey is an amalgamation of design and code. With a focused grasp on SQL and Web Development, my passion finds its home in crafting digital landscapes. I'm not only proficient in code but also well-versed in design tools.

## A Canvas Beyond Code üé¨üé•
My canvas extends beyond code to the realm of visual storytelling and creativity. I've been an integral part of Technity, a platform that embraced both aesthetics and functionality. My involvement as a volunteer in organizing the "HTML and CSS Workshop" showcased my commitment to both the visual and structural aspects of web development. Competitive events like ['Algorithm & Coding Quiz'](https://github.com/aloukikjoshi/technity-tasks/blob/main/introspection/anokha%20certificates/Algorithm%20%26%20Coding%20Quiz.jpg) and ['Code Father'](https://github.com/aloukikjoshi/technity-tasks/blob/main/introspection/anokha%20certificates/Code%20Father.jpg) by Anokha highlighted my prowess in designing efficient algorithms and elegant code. My multidimensional interests were exemplified in the Tata Crucible Quiz, where I ventured into the world of management and beyond.

## Leadership and Beyond üöÄ
Leadership comes naturally to me, and it's not confined to lines of code. As the Chair at the IEEE Student Branch, I've embraced the responsibility of steering a community towards excellence. Rejoining Technity is not just a return, but a resurgence of my commitment to technology, design, and the harmonious blend of the two.
