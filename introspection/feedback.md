# Feedback on Selection Process :sparkles:

The process is good, especially the idea of task-series :thumbsup:. It makes the enthusiasts work and complete it within a required amount of time.

About the interview I can't comment now. If the faculties are :white_check_mark: taking interviews then it will be much better and fairer.

I just want to say that faculties' intervention must be present in the scoring of task-series and interviews.

Also, diversity should be maintained within the club for opportunities with giving respect to the talent and skills and avoiding discrimination on any basis. :heart:
