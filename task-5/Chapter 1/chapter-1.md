1) *, -, /, + are the operators and the rest are the values.

2) spam is a varialbe and 'spam' is a string.

3) Integer (represented as int), float and string.

4) An expression in Python is a combination of values, variables, operators, and functions that can be evaluated to produce a result. It represents calculations, comparisons, or operations and produces a value with a specific data type.

5) Assignment is used to store a value in a variable. It involves using the equal sign (=) to associate a value with a variable name. For example:
   x = 10
   name = "Alice"
   In an assignment, the right-hand side is evaluated, and the resulting value is stored in the variable on the left-hand side.
   
   An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and functions that produces a single value when evaluated. It doesn't change the state of variables or store values. For example:
   result = x + 5
   total = 2 * (result + 3)

6) No change. bacon is still equal to 20.

7) spamspamspam

8) Because according to the rules of variable naming in python, the names of variable should not start with a number.

9) int(), float() and str() are the thrree functions by which we can convert one data type to other, this is called type-casting.

10) The error occurs because 99 is not in string data type so it cannot concatenate. To correct it it should be typecasted using str() function.
    result = 'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'
