8) Using logging is better than print() because it offers:
* Control: You can filter message severity.
* Configurability: Messages can go to various places.
* Maintainability: Conventional and organized.
* Flexibility: Easily change logging behavior.
* Error Handling: Better for error management.

9) * Step Over (or Next): Executes the current line of code, moving to the next line, and treats function calls as a single step without entering them. Useful for skipping over function details.

* Step In (or Step Into): Enters the function or method called on the current line, allowing to debug its code. Falls back to "Step Over" behavior if no function call is present.

* Step Out: Continues execution until the current function is exited, returning to the calling context. Useful for quickly moving out of a function you've stepped into.

10) When you click "Continue" in a debugger, the debugger will continue the execution of your program without interruption until a breakpoint is hit, an exceptin is raised or the program ends.

11) A breakpoint is a designated point in your code where program execution pauses during debugging, allowing the coder to inspect variables and analyze the program's state.

12) Click the line number where you want the breakpoint.
