11) 'break' and 'continue' are control flow statements in Python. They are used within loops (such as for and while loops) to control the flow of the program.

12) In Python, all three of the following expressions are equivalent when used in a for loop:
    range(10)
    range(0, 10)
    range(0, 10, 1)
These expressions all create an iterable sequence of numbers from 0 (inclusive) to 10 (exclusive) with a step size of 1. In other words, they represent the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The difference lies in the way they are written, but the behavior is the same.
