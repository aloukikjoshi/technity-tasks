1) Certainly, here are the advantages of using    functions in your programs as single points:
* Modularity: Breaks code into manageable pieces.
* Reusability: Reduces code duplication.
* Abstraction: Hides implementation details.
* Readability: Enhances code clarity.

2) When the function is called.

3) def function_name(parameters):

4) A function is a reusable block of code with a specific purpose.
A function call is when you use that function to execute its code with specific inputs.

5) There is one global scope in a Python program.
Local scopes are created for each function call, and their number depends on how many functions are called and how often they are called.

6) When a function call is returned, the values of variables in the local scope are destroyed. New values are assigned when a function is called again.

7) A return value is the value that a function gives back as its result when it completes its execution. A return value can be part of an expression.

8) If a function in Python does not have a return statement, the function implicitly returns a special value called None.

9) We can force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable by using the global keyword in Python

10) The data type of None is called NoneType.

11) It attempts to import a Python module named "areallyourpetsnamederic."

12) import spam
    spam.bacon()

13) Implementing exception handling (try-catch blocks).

14) Certainly, let's make it even simpler:-
Try: Put risky code here.
Except: Specify what to do if things go wrong
