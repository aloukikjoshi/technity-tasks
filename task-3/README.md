## üìù Approach

For the initial task involving JavaScript, I opted for a single-file solution. With limited familiarity in working with Bootstrap, I chose a more minimalist library to craft a straightforward 'Sign Up' form. My approach involved utilizing numerous div containers alongside various classes to structure the content. Within the scripting realm, I employed event listeners and functions to execute password validation. An alert system was implemented to address scenarios where the password and confirm password input fields mismatch.
